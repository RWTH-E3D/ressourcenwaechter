## Key Features

- **Modular IEQ monitoring system**

  Open-source system for monitoring key IEQ parameters, designed for real-world field studies and long-term deployment.

- **Multi-sensor data acquisition**

  Support for air temperature, humidity, illuminance, sound level, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, VOC, wind speed, window status, electric power, and other IEQ sensors, with synchronized data collection and time-stamping.

- **Autonomous system**

  On-device GUI providing real-time visualization, intuitive interaction, and immediate feedback without requiring an external computer or internet connection. All data are stored locally on a microSD card.

- **Behavior-oriented feedback system**

  Context-aware feedback and recommendations aiming to support more resource-/energy-efficient and healthy user behavior, based on measured IEQ conditions.

## License

The *Ressourcenwächter (Resource Guardian)* project is a mixed open-source project consisting of software, firmware, hardware designs, documentation, feedback content, and third-party visual assets.
Different components of the project are released under different licenses, as outlined below.
Please read this section carefully before reusing or redistributing any part of the project.

### Software & Firmware

The codebase is structured into three main components:

1. **Firmware:** Code running on embedded microcontrollers.

2. **Software for touch display GUI:** Graphical user interface running directly on the monitoring device.

<!-- 3. **Desktop software:** Desktop applications running on computers. -->
