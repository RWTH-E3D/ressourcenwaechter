# Hardware Design

The hardware consists of two parts:

1. An enclosure optimized based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, including 3D printing files.
2. A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for electrical connections to sensors and microcontrollers,

## Enclosure

The enclosure's design files can be found [here](./enclosure) (`./enclosure`), including:

1. Models in STL/STEP format
2. Project files for 3D printing



## PCB

The PCB files can be found [here](./pcb) (`./pcb`), including:

1. Schematics
2. Production files
