1. First install the Nextion software normally. 
2. Now copy the entire software folder to another location (otherwise it will be overwritten by the USART even by using different path). 
3. Now install the USART HMI software from TJC. 
4. Make sure not to install it in the previous Nextion folder (e.g. change the Nextion folder name to USART).
5. After the installation is complete, restore the Nextion Editor folder that was previously saved somewhere else.
6. After that you can use both versions at the same time, which saves a lot of effort.

Or first install USART HMI and then Nextion editor, it also works.
